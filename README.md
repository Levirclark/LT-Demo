# LT-Demo

This is a demo of the requested console application for Lean TECHniques.
The application is written in java. To start the application, load the project into intellij. (It's possible to run the project in other IDEs, but intellij works best.)
Then, navigate to src/main/java/Main.java. Right click the class, and select "Run 'Main.main()'".
A console will appear at the bottom of the screen which you can enter the desired photo album into.
To run the tests, right click the src/test folder, and select "Run 'All Tests'".
